Idea:
- a world map with a timeline slider that shows where coups have taken place. for example, if the year is 1954, then all the coups that occurred
in that year -- 1954 -- will show on the world map. perhaps use google maps api?
- show a bar chart (x-axis: year) (y-axis: number of coups) to show how often coups happened during a specific year
- quiz - making a quiz about the coups
